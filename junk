    Code Cleanup:
    Encapsulated ExtendedPropertiesProvider in Validators to minimize impact
    on back-porting to Kepler.
    Refactored some stuff into new MarkerUtils class and improved
    gotoMarker() behavior in editor.
    Refactored PropertySheet behavior into PropertyUtil.


    Bug 458665 - grid and canvas style preferences are ignored. Patch
    applied.


    Bug 458443 - background of sections elements in ObjectEditingDialog are
    white. Patch applied.


    More validation cleanup:
    External Process IDs (those invoked by jbpm "Reusable Process") need to
    be checked.
    Problem Markers on Activities not cleared if Problem resulted from an
    element contained by Activity (e.g. DataInput).
    DataInput and DataOutput in MultiInstanceLoopCharacteristics need to be
    checked.
    Creating DataAssociation between DataObject and Intermediate Events
    should not display DataInput/DataOutput selection popup.
    Added LoopCharacteristics validators.


    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1138987 - Expression
    language is not saved the first time after a new Timer Event is created.
    Undo most of the changes from previous commit - not necessary.

    Bug 457995 - Regression: problem decorators are no longer drawn
    Added container object to Status result locus so decorators are drawn on
    activities if a Data Input/Output is in error.


    Bug 458431 - Regression: Morph activity/gateway no longer working.
    Reconnect Boundary Events to morphed Activity.


    Remove duplicate Problem messages reported by (possible) multiple calls
    to the same validator.
    Remove duplicate DataInput/DataOutput property tabs when property dialog
    opened from Problems view.


    Bug 458431 - Regression: Morph activity/gateway no longer working.
    Apparently this has been broken for a while :(


    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1183743 - - "Data Input
    Association has missing or incomplete Source" when UserTask is added.
    Added a Property tab for BPMN2 Property objects (a.k.a. "local
    variables")


    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1183743 - - "Data Input
    Association has missing or incomplete Source" when UserTask is added.
    Changed error message to "Input/Output Parmater <name> is uninitialized"
    which is more meaningful. Also ignore these errors for WID tasks.


    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1184422 - Escalation and
    Signal in process definitions cause validation errors.
    Some more cleanup. Making sure validation constraints are only invoked
    once.


    Bug 458294 - Property popup dialog does not update file dirty state when
    opened from Outline or Problems view


    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1183743 - "Data Input
    Association has missing or incomplete Source" when UserTask is added
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1184422 - Escalation and
    Signal in process definitions cause validation errors
    Reorganized the jBPM validators.
    Added jBPM validators for Escalation and Signal to ignore
    itemSubjectRef.
    Improved editor's "goto marker" handling: now pops up the property
    editing dialog for problems that do not reference a PictogramElement
    (e.g. Message, Signal, Escalation, GlobalType, etc.)


    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178839 - Process is
    deformed when special characters are used.
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1183853 - Modeler replace a
    character '<' to "&lt" when user inputs charactoers to a business
    process id and save it.
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1179075 - Modeler
    automatically change an input charactor to '_'.
    Enhanced AbstractDetailComposite to allow ExtendedPropertiesAdapter to
    define its own ObjectEditor for specific object features.


    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178839 - Process is
    deformed when special characters are used. This adds some more
    validation on BaseElement IDs, and a new User Preference, "Text Limit"
    which limits the number of characters that can be entered into a simple
    Text field (Multiline text boxes are not affected).
    Fixed a bug for GlobalTypes which failed to synchronize the
    GlobalType.identifier with its ID.
    Fixed typo in AbstractBpmn2ElementValidator factory method
    getValidator().
    Added validation for Process.packageName in jBPM plugin.
    Perform Live validation just before save, and abort saving if model is
    found to be corrupt (invalid ID string, duplicate IDs, etc. - see
    BaseElementValidator).


    Bug 455897 - Missing support for XPath conditions


    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1168413 -  BPMN2 process
    designed in Eclipse tooling plug-in/jBPM Web Designer does not generate
    the Assignment in dataInputAssociation for Skippable property for a User
    Task by default. This change adds the ability to assign <property
    ref=...> values to object EAttributes, not just EReferences; the ID of
    the referenced object will be converted to String and assigned to the
    object's feature if possible. This assumes that the EAttribute is of
    type EString.
